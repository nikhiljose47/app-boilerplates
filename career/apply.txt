Respected Hiring Manager,

I am a Senior Flutter Developer with 5+ years of experience in building scalable, high-performance cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter and Dart. 
I recently worked at CitiusTech, where I design and deliver configurable Flutter libraries for enterprise healthcare systems, owning architecture, testing, documentation, and performance optimization. 
Previously, I contributed to healthcare and edtech platforms, including a Flutter app recognized as a top-five finalist in the Global Learning XPRIZE and rated 4.4 on the Play Store. 
I bring strong expertise in system design, performance profiling, and clean architecture, and I am eager to contribute to impactful, innovation-driven teams.

Sincerely,
Nikhil Jose

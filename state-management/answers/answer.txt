What are the core parts of BLoC?

1.Event → user/action trigger
2.Bloc → converts event → state
3.State → UI output

Schema:
UI → Event → Bloc → State → UI


What is event?

Example:
class IncrementEvent {}


What is a state?
A State represents the current UI data.

Example:
class CounterState {
  final int count;
  CounterState(this.count);
}


How UI access Bloc?
context.read<CounterBloc>()
context.watch<CounterBloc>()


What does a Bloc class do?
It listens to events and emits new states.


What is Cubit?
Cubit is a simplified state management class from the Bloc library that emits new states directly through methods without using events, making it suitable for less complex logic.
Why Cubit was introduced? - Because developers felt: Many features didn’t need events.

=> Cubit is a class from the bloc package!! used for: Block without event class system ie Bloc package has Bloc and Cubit

Cubit example:
class CounterCubit extends Cubit<int> {
  CounterCubit() : super(0);

  void increment() {
    emit(state + 1);
  }
}

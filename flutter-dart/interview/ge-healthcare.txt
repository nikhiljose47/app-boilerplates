Intro
At GE healthcare, we were design and developing a single consolidated package = contained 5 core features

Initially i was involved in end-to-end in requirement discusssiouns and architecture designs on how to implement.

The client requirement was to have a single Flutter package that could be imported into multiple applications and 
provide ready-to-use UI widgets 

Essentially = The consuming application did not handle any UI logic. Instead, it simply passed data and configuration to the 
widget, and the package was responsible for rendering the complete UI on the app screen.The package handled business rules, 
visual states, and layout selection internally.

Other Requiremntn were - must highly configurable, not break the ui on configuration change, minimal state management, reusability,
unit testung for each components, architect the classs so the it can easily maintained, perfomance check and report


Major challenge was to put boundaries on developing each modules so that each developer must not afftec or change others.


Basic schema: (of use)
Inside package - 
health_ui_package/
 └── lib/
     ├── health_ui_package.dart   // public API
     ├── alarm/
     │    └── alarm_banner.dart
     ├── numerics/
     │    ├── numerics_widget.dart
     │    └── layouts/
     │         ├── layout1.dart
     │         └── layout2.dart
     └── common/
          └── models.dart


A public api file to expose -
library health_ui_package;

export 'alarm/alarm_banner.dart';
export 'numerics/numerics_widget.dart';
export 'common/models.dart';

3.Add dependency -
dependencies:
  health_ui_package:
    git:
      url: <repo-url>

4.import 'package:health_ui_package/health_ui_package.dart';
AlarmBanner(  //Use required package only
  data: AlarmData(
    message: 'High heart rate',
    severity: AlarmSeverity.high,
  ),
  config: AlarmConfig(
    showIcon: true,
  ),
)


Socket data inetgratokn part 

There was mock data which was common across to help in development

Mock data was consolideated data which contains all the information at once, like numerics, waveform data, alarm data 

We need to filter for numerics given thr parameter.
